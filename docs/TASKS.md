# Website prototype task board

Sole website/admin repository: `H:/Work/TheAviationArcade/website`.
Unity is a read-only reference for approved branding/content. Do not create a website
folder there. Read README.md and actual Git status when resuming.

## Accepted scope and decisions

- Homepage, seven-game catalog, photographer photo proposals, and admin for Aircraft
  Identifier and Plane of the Day, preserving the existing branding.
- Product authentication: Firebase email/password and Google only. The private host
  access gate is separate and must not grant product permissions.
- Callsign is the existing community player name tag. Game-account linkage and an
  authoritative Callsign claim service remain future work; do not create another registry.
- Luna handles scoped implementation; 6.1 Sol low/medium handles complex planning/review.
- Demo content/credentials remain local and nonpublishable. Browser gameplay,
  commerce and game-backend content delivery are outside this slice.

## Verification contract

README.md contains the supported commands. Run source checks, then browser suites
against local Firebase Auth/D1/R2 emulation. Suites mutate local fixtures and should
run sequentially. Evidence JSON must describe passes, failures and skipped provider
checks honestly. No credentials, session tokens or real private data belong in evidence.
The Google helper script is blocked by the local auth harness; provider authentication
is not established by that case.

Preserve `.dev.vars`, database state and credentials outside Git. Generated dependencies,
runtime caches, builds and publication archives are ignored. Restore only known task-owned
artifacts; do not discard unrelated work. Make focused commits without rewriting published history.

## Publication checkpoint

The Firebase runtime checkpoint is `22d6e332df8e22afd9e074f0ed4bce1f4d6f7b77`.
Deployment `appgdep_6ada24c613d88191a1105d4f8e9df4f0` succeeded on 2026-10-22,
using environment revision 2. This supersedes runtime `ddd569f` and its earlier
deployment. Later documentation-only commits do not change the deployed implementation.

The source changes are organized as:

- `7d848c9` — Firebase email/Google account flows, staff/contributor controls and local setup tooling.
- `82f4551` — JWT/account tests, distinct-user browser verification and current workflow evidence.
- `22d6e33` — README startup instructions, Firebase guide, account/security scope and repo guidelines.

The same [private website](https://airplane-games-community-prototype.givingstar7.chatgpt.site),
[admin](https://airplane-games-community-prototype.givingstar7.chatgpt.site/admin) and
[photographer portal](https://airplane-games-community-prototype.givingstar7.chatgpt.site/contribute)
retain their owner-private audience. No product domain or public launch was changed.

Public navigation retains native anchors because an earlier production audit reproduced a
Vinext beta prefetch issue. Historical Lighthouse/production-smoke artifacts predate the
Firebase integration unless their evidence explicitly records a later source checkpoint.
